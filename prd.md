# Sentiment Tracker Bot - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Sentiment Tracker is a Slack bot designed to collect, analyze, and report team sentiment. It allows team members to provide feedback on their work experience, which is then anonymized, analyzed using AI, and reported back to the team channel.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Feedback Collection
- **Trigger Mechanism**: Any team member can initiate feedback collection via Slack command
- **Command Syntax**: 
  - `@sentiment-bot gather feedback for @team-group-name` (uses default time window)
  - `@sentiment-bot gather feedback for @team-group-name in X minutes` (custom time window)
- **Time Window**:
  - Default: 5-minute collection window
  - Custom: User-specified duration
  - Reminder: Bot sends a reminder message 1 minute before the window closes
  - Cutoff: Only responses received within the time window are included

### 2. Feedback Questions
The MVP will include three fixed questions:
1. "How are you feeling about this week?" (Scale 1-3, using emojis üòä üòê üòü)
2. "What went well this week?"
3. "What could have gone better?"

The architecture should support future customization of questions.

### 3. User Interface
- **Collection Method**: Slack modal dialog
- **Question Format**:
  - Sentiment question: Emoji buttons (üòä üòê üòü)
  - Open-ended questions: Text input fields
- **Modal Design**: Single modal containing all three questions

### 4. Report Generation
- **Delivery**: Report sent back to the original channel where the bot was called
- **Content**:
  - Summary of overall team sentiment (based on emoji responses)
  - Key themes identified from qualitative responses
  - Anonymized quotes (rewritten by AI to standardize style and further mask identity)
  - Visual representation of overall mood using emojis
- **Templates**: Basic customization with preset options:
  - Comprehensive (all data points)
  - Brief summary (highlights only)
  - Focus on improvements
- **Low Response Handling**: Generate report anyway but note the low response rate

## Technical Specifications

### 1. Architecture
- **Framework**: Bolt for Python (building on existing Slackbot project)
- **Deployment**: Containerized for deployment in in-house Kubernetes cluster
- **Multi-team Support**: Must handle multiple teams using the bot simultaneously

### 2. Data Storage
- **Database**: Cloud-based NoSQL database (DynamoDB or MongoDB Atlas)
- **Data Model**:
  - Teams collection: Team ID, team name, configuration settings
  - Feedback sessions collection: Session ID, team ID, timestamp, duration, channel ID
  - Responses collection: Response ID, session ID, user ID (hashed), sentiment score, positive feedback, improvement feedback, timestamp
  - Reports collection: Report ID, session ID, summary, themes, anonymized quotes, statistics
- **Historical Data**: Store data for trend analysis over time
- **Retention Policy**: Configurable data retention policies set by workspace admins

### 3. AI Integration
- **Provider**: OpenAI
- **Use Cases**:
  - Sentiment analysis of textual responses
  - Theme identification from qualitative feedback
  - Quote anonymization and standardization
  - Summary generation for reports
- **Implementation**:
  - API integration with appropriate rate limiting and error handling
  - Prompt engineering for consistent results
  - Fallback mechanisms if AI service is unavailable

### 4. Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: For MVP, any team member can trigger sentiment collection
- **Data Privacy**:
  - All individual feedback anonymized in reports
  - User IDs hashed in database
  - AI-based rewriting of quotes to further mask identity
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention periods

## Implementation Details

### 1. Slack Integration
- **Bot Permissions Required**:
  - `chat:write` - Send messages
  - `users:read` - Access user information
  - `usergroups:read` - Access user group information
  - `im:write` - Send direct messages
  - `commands` - Create slash commands
  - `views:write` - Open and update modals
- **Event Subscriptions**:
  - `message.channels` - Listen for messages in channels
  - `message.im` - Listen for direct messages
- **Interactive Components**:
  - Button actions for emoji selection
  - Modal submission for feedback

### 2. Workflow
1. User triggers bot with command in a channel
2. Bot identifies members of the specified user group
3. Bot sends DM with modal to each member
4. Bot tracks responses and sends reminder before deadline
5. At deadline, bot processes all received feedback
6. Bot uses OpenAI to analyze sentiment, identify themes, and anonymize quotes
7. Bot generates and posts report to the original channel
8. Bot stores session data for historical analysis

### 3. Error Handling
- **Notification Levels**:
  - Critical errors: Notify in channel where bot was triggered
  - Minor issues: Log without user disruption
  - Severe technical problems: Notify system administrators
- **Specific Error Scenarios**:
  - API rate limits: Implement exponential backoff
  - Database connection issues: Retry with timeout
  - User not found: Graceful error message
  - OpenAI API unavailable: Fall back to basic analysis

### 4. Performance Considerations
- **Scalability**:
  - Handle multiple concurrent feedback sessions
  - Support teams of various sizes (5-500+ members)
- **Latency**:
  - Modal response time < 1 second
  - Report generation < 30 seconds after deadline
- **Resource Usage**:
  - Memory and CPU requirements documented for Kubernetes deployment

## Installation & Documentation

### 1. Installation
- One-click installation from Slack App Directory
- Configuration options documented for admin setup

### 2. Documentation
- **In-app Help**:
  - `@sentiment-bot help` command for basic instructions
  - Contextual help in modals
- **External Documentation**:
  - Setup guide
  - User guide
  - Admin guide
  - API documentation (for future integrations)

## Testing Plan

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test all core functions independently
- Mock external services (Slack API, OpenAI)
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test interaction between components
- Verify database operations
- Test API integrations with real credentials in test environment

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Complete workflow testing
- Performance testing under load
- Security testing

### 4. User Acceptance Testing
- Internal team testing before release
- Feedback collection from early adopters

## Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. System Monitoring
- Application health metrics
- API response times
- Error rates and types
- Resource utilization

### 2. Usage Analytics
- Number of feedback sessions
- Response rates
- Question completion rates
